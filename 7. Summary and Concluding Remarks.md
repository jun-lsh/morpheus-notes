Let's directly answer the questions posed at the very beginning.

- Who are the main contributors, contribution type, contact info/profiles? E.g. https://twitter.com/DJohnstonEC
	- David A. Johnston and Scott Berenzweig are your big dogs. There is no Neo, no Trinity, no Morpheus. It's just these guys.
	- Socials and info are in document 1.

- Why should we be interested in what Morpheus is building? From first glance the mvp seems to be an LLM run by a decentralized network + some customization to translate natural language to EVM transactions.
	- Their value proposition is that they're giving easy access to LLMs that will be cheaper than getting an OpenAI license. This doesn't seem to be the case.

- How does it work under the hood? Does it make sense or is it all smokescreens?
	- Refer to documents 2 and 3 for an in depth look
	- The basic idea (let people with compute resources run LLMs, let those without such resources get inferences from those LLMs) is sound, but the proposed implementation is needlessly complicated, confusing and inconsistent
	- The rewards system (rewarding of compute providers) does not seem robust and is easily gameable
	- Lots of subjectivity and oddities such as in the inference quality rating, how coding contributions are weighed, etc.

- Whatâ€™s the state of the project? Is the product live? Can we run it? Key future dates/timeline
	- The project is a mess
	- There is no live product besides the token that's been deployed
	- You cannot bid for compute because they haven't even figured out what that is, nor is there anything implemented. 
	- There is no roadmap
	- Refer to documents 4 to 6 for an in depth look.


__Concluding Remarks__

This looks like vaporwave to me. They've come up with a hundred buzzwords (Yellowstone model, Lumerin Node, Techno Capital Machine) to describe what they're doing, but at the end of the day it's just a needlessly complex, unnecessarily Web3 P2P LLM prompting system in which anything notable proposed has yet to be implemented in any appreciable capacity.

If you want a quick buck, speculation alone will probably drive the token value. If you want an actual product, this ragtag team of "open source devs" purely incentivized to contribute by receiving a cut of the tokens... it doesn't seem like they'd be able to deliver on their promises.
