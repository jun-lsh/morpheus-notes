__Founders__

Supposedly anonymous founders, whitepaper authors don the pseudonyms "Morpheus", "Trinity" and "Neo". 

Given that Morpheus builds off "Smart Agents" (https://www.smartagent.org/) and the latter explicitly makes reference to Morpheus as its "local implimentation (sic)", it seems like the devs for SmartAgents are likely responsible for Morpheus as well.

I don't understand the need for the incessant Matrix references besides mystic, aesthetic and "vibe".


__Team__

Claim from their Discord: "Morpheus is fully decentralized and driven by a community of open source contributors." 

Cross referencing the GitHub pages for both SmartAgents and Morpheus, we find the following individuals:

- David A. Johnston ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/DJohnstonEC), [GitHub](https://github.com/DavidAJohnston), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidajohnston))
	- Responsible for the SmartAgents framework, heavily involved in both Morpheus and SmartAgents as a developer
	- He's the one who init the Morpheus GitHub repo, uploaded the WP, YP etc. so let's just assume that he's also the "founder" of Morpheus

- Scott Berenzweig ([GitHub](https://github.com/betterbrand), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/betterbrand), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottberenzweig/))
	- Appears to be another key dev for both SmartAgents and Morpheus
	- Bulk of docs have been uploaded or updated by this guy

- Anton B. ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonboss/), [GitHub](https://github.com/antonbosss))
	- Despite being second highest in terms of commits, he seems to only be responsible for translations of docs to Russian and Ukranian
	- Could be trying to game the token distribution (refer to document 3)

- Jason Buchanan ([GitHub](https://github.com/jsnbuchanan), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsnbuchanan), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsnbuchanan/))
	- Appears to have been involved early on in both projects, but has had no appreciable activity concerning them recently

Other contributors involved do appear to be independent devs, the key incentive for contributing appears to be the allocation of MOR tokens that go towards Coders, where [ones contributions are weighted](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md) and your allocation is determined by that weight.

From contribution history alone as well as social media activity, it seems like David and Scott are the key minds behind both SmartAgents and Morpheus, being their primary contributors.
