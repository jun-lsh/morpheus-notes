Questions to start you off:

- Who are the main contributors, contribution type, contact info/profiles? E.g. https://twitter.com/DJohnstonEC

- Why should we be interested in what Morpheus is building? From first glance the mvp seems to be an LLM run by a decentralized network + some customization to translate natural language to EVM transactions.

- How does it work under the hood? Does it make sense or is it all smokescreens?

- Whatâ€™s the state of the project? Is the product live? Can we run it? Key future dates/timeline
