## __TL;DR__
Nothing of note has been implemented. 

https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Smart%20Contracts/Overview.md

[__Router__](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/c3012007db93f10d8d345b0f3f935598c12c21f4/contract_library/contracts/Router.sol)

The heart of the Morpheus' "decentralized LLM" claim, the contract that's supposed to enable payouts to compute and hookups between users and providers. It is currently... a whole lot of nothing, quite literally.

[MOR](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/SmartContracts/blob/main/contracts/MOR.sol)

Just an ERC20 token implementation. Nothing else interesting.

-------

I'd look into the other contracts, but giving them a cursory glance, I see nothing relevant to the tech stack that was previously brought up. As it stands, these are just the bare minimum needed for you to mint a token, distribute it and communicate between an L1 and L2.
