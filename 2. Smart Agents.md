__TL;DR__
Smart Agents are supposed to be the core of Morpheus. They're meant to be finetuned LLMs that pick out contracts to use (after translating your commands) through a "Smart Contract Rank" (which is 1. not live 2. extremely subjective 3. probably gameable).

There exists no actual implementation of this framework as described, and what can at best be called a "loose interpretation" of it exists on the Morpheus repo (more on that later)


__First Blush__

Before we can look into Morpheus, we first have to understand what the "Smart Agents" are.

Demo WebApp is non-functional: https://www.chatweb3.org/ and is still "under construction". Not promising.

Website also looks very plain: https://www.smartagent.org/, links point to https://mor.org/, misspelled "implementation".

Two other links point to [Smart Contract Rank](https://www.smartcontractrank.org/) (we'll look at this later) and [SmartAgency.AI](https://www.smartagency.ai/) (meant to link up devs to clients who want custom smart agents).

__Whitepaper__

- Smart Agents are posited as a "neural protocol", which is a pompous way of saying "fine-tuned local LLM that can interact with smart contracts".  

- Quote: "Each day the user confirms their Smart Agent is benefiting them and acting according to their goals by approving the actions it prompts the user to take." 
	- Not some fully automated LLM solution, still requires human approval for tasks

- Quote: "All secured with cryptography that is impossible for an AI to generate or fake."
	- Sounds like fluff, just states value proposition of crypto in general

- Incentive model: devs create smart contracts the the LLM can interact with. If the smart contract generates yield (e.g. ETH staking), then a cut of the yield is "donated" to the dev.
	- Why should I interact with contracts that take a cut? And are these not just contracts which already exist and are just modified to a) be easier(?) to interface with for the LLM and b) take a commission?

- Local Smart Agent is just AutoGPT with Web3 wallet integration

- Quote: "Developers that contribute to this software will gain part of the ETH yield from the Staking and other default programs running on the software" 
	- Need to look into the "other default programs"

- Quote: "The core benefit of the Smart Agent approach is to deeply connect / tether their AI to peoples' private keys. It's truly the one thing AI cannot generate."
	- I still don't understand the emphasis on this point, right now what I'm hearing is just there being an LLM that acts as a proxy for a human to interact with dApps and nothing more. 

__Proposed Task Implementation__

"One of the modules is based on the task.mstr file, which logs what the Smart Agents do for the Smart Agent Owner. A task assigned to a Smart Agent is named with a .tsk extension. i.e. StakeEth.tsk.

A Smart Agent can have only one .mstr file, which records the status of its origination time, software version number, module configuration and tasks performed through the life of the Smart Agent. Published on the Ethereum blockchain (potentially moved to Polygon to reduce gas costs), this log condensed adds a layer of security since no two Smart Agents can ever have the same .mstr file, i.e an “Smart Agent_ID”."

I cannot find any examples of these files in the repo. It is also unclear why they're publishing logs based on this .mstr file.

__Yellowpaper__

- Quote: "Smart Agents let people talk to Smart Contracts with confidence because Smart Contract Rank to showing them the most used and decentralized options. So, a new adopter of crypto will use their Smart Agent as a guide."

I think we should address the Smart Contract Rank. 

Supposedly, devs would publish smart contracts that are compatible with the local Smart Agent LLM stack. Then, the contract is scored based on the number of transactions performed with it, the "Dapps score" and the "DeFi Score"

- The "Dapps score" is based on "how many of 10 values listed in the Smart Agent paper are implemented by the Blockchain the Smart Contract operates on"
- The "Defi score" is "calculated by detailing how decentralized each smart contract’s operations are."

These are two astonishingly vague conditions. The site itself even posits that these Smart Contract Ranks would be published via an API on their site, which seems to go against the ethos of "decentralisation".

- Pipeline seems to be built atop langchain.
	- This pipeline also seems to be [needlessly complicated](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/1563345/255453035-0aedf070-d6ae-4488-9b24-3f5ddd527408.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.Npr57j-b-sie1ZskzODjrIC9sehWjts1ZKbHOQc7drk) and confusing

- Quote: "For dapps outside the Smart Contract Rank algorithm, all financial transactions will add a 10% to the user."
	- ... what?

__SDKs__

No SDKs seem to have been developed. 

__Test Application__

~~TODO: deploy and see whats up~~

From the looks of it, the "SmartAgents" framework as a standalone has been largely abandoned and is basically indistinguishable from the base LLM that Morpheus provides. We'll look more into that later.

__Concluding Remarks__

The Smart Agent framework does not seem very promising. The tech stack itself is fairly rudimentary and as of right now, seems to only comprise of a local LLM that can interface with dApps and nothing more. 

The commission system, ranking system seem to add unnecessary complexity without any apparent benefit. On top of that, there do not appear to be any live versions of these products (as a standalone stack) to demo.
